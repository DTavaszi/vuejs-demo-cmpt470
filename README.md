4. Go to project folder in terminal

5. Run "vagrant up"

6. Run "vagrant provision" (in case it didn't provision)

# Setup SSH

1. Follow instructions to generate SSH:

2. https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/

   `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` <- to print the public key to screen so you can copy it to your account settings on GitHub

3. To always use SSH:

   `git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/`
